# Popcorn-Popping
A university level ANOVA project, first one I ever completed. April 2019.

## Popcorn Report
This is a full-fledged report complete with an apendix detailing the methods and results from start to finish. This report includes some graphics made in R and some in Microsoft Excel.

## Popcorn Popping Final
This is an alternative, powerpoint style presentation method of the methods and results of the project.

## Popcorn Code
This was the first project I ever completed in R. As such, the code may have some inefficiencies. However, I purposefully decided to publish the code "as is" to illustrate how much I have learned when comparing this project to others.
